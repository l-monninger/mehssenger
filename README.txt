Hi Professor or Grader or whomever,

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I hope it helps you to grade my site.

First and foremost, there aren't any special permissions needed to make all of the features of my site work. That said, it will be easier to appreciate
what the site can do if you use the following login:

	username: test
	password: test123
	
This account already has a bunch of message threads set up and contacts put in. I encourage you to make your own account as well, but this should allow you to
see some of what a mature account looks like and get through the grading faster.

Resolved Bug Note: You'll notice, when looking at some of the earlier messages in test's inbox, that the day number in the date is off. This was an issue
caused by accidentally using .getDay() instead of .getDate in JS. It has since been resolved.


Stuff to Tryout:

(Account)
1. Start with the contact page, try adding a contact with the username "bi" (this user does not exist). Note the similar users suggestions that appear under the
username line edit after having attempted to add this contact.
2. Also on the contact page, try adding one of the users which is already in the contact book.
3. Also on the contact page, try updating a contact on the fly.

(Inbox)
4. Jump over to the Inbox page, try starting a new thread with the "Make Thread" button at the bottom right of the screen. Input the username, contact book name
or contact book email of your desired contact, and, whether or not there is already a thread with that user, a message will be sent.
5. Also in the "Make Thread" pop-up, change the style of the message. Note what happens to the background.
6. At the left of the Inbox page should be a series of thin lines. Hover over these lines to view the navigational element. Click on a name and you will navigate
to the thread with that contact.
7. Respond inline under one of the threads. Try using the 'ctrl' + 'enter' shortcut.
8. If you have the time to open two accounts in two browsers, try sending yourself a message from another account and watching it pop-up without having to refresh
the page
9. Note the replacement of standard usernames with contact usernames.

(Terminal)
10. Send a simple message to one contact using the terminal syntax. (Submit with 'ctrl' + 'enter'). Go back to inbox to see the message.
11. Go crazy. Format a message like wild. Send to a bunch of users and attempt to send to a bunch of nonusers, just maintain the syntax and see what happens.
12. Depart from the syntax. Notice that the command will not be submitted.

(About)
13. When in doubt, see About.
